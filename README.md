# Multi-Agent Systems Research

## 📌 About the Project

This repository contains research and analysis projects on multi-agent systems, focusing on reinforcement learning (RL), rule-based systems, and large language model (LLM) frameworks with swarm intelligence and decentralized decision-making capabilities.

## 🛠 Sub-Projects

### CrewAI-agent
A multi-agent system for automated content research and article writing:
- Implements a three-agent workflow (Planner, Writer, Editor)
- Demonstrates collaborative AI task execution
- Serves as a template for more complex multi-agent systems

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi-agent architecture** for distributed decision-making
- **Comparative framework analysis** of RL, rule-based, and LLM approaches
- **Swarm intelligence** implementation examples
- **Modular design** for easy agent addition/removal
